    "The [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa_Observatory), on the Big Island of Hawaii, is the world's oldest continuous carbon dioxide (C02) monitoring station. In this exercise, I would like you make the `mauna_loa` directory, which already exists in this homework folder, a Git repository. You should make a Git commit for the initial state of the repository, which contains `mauna_loa.csv`, a file with CO2 data for last 60+ years, `ml.py`, a template for a python program you will complete, and `mauna_loa.ipynb`, the Jupyter notebook which will call functions from the .py file.<br><br>\n",
